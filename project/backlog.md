# Project backlog

This is a product backlog just for pre-v1.0.0 release. After that, bugs, features, and enhancements will be managed in Github Issues, and/or [todo.md](../todo.md)

## First steps

## Backlog

### Todo

- 🔘 Verify the Windows paths on real Windows hardware: symlink recreate (file vs dir flag, privilege), junction reparse-buffer write, and `.lnk` `TargetPath` set/save. (Because...built and cross-compiled from Linux.)

### Bugs

### New features and enhancements

- 🔘 CICD process: Rigorous testing of all features, possible combinations (valid and invalid), except not on live files.

### Deferred

### Canceled

### Done

#### Done - First steps

- ✅ Scaffold Go project, build/cross-compile matrix, CICD engine + config + test harness.
- ✅ Core CLI: custom arg parser (prefix abbreviation, `=`/space values, positional START/FROM/TO).
- ✅ Filters: include/exclude regex, name and wholename globs, and re-include, as one ordered pipeline.
- ✅ Recursive walk collecting symlinks, loop-safe (no dir-symlink follow), `--max-depth`.
- ✅ Repoint engine: regex `--from` + template `--to` (`$1`), literal `--literal`, apply-by-default, or show first with `--dry-run`.
- ✅ POSIX (Linux/BSD/macOS) symlink read/atomic rewrite.
- ✅ Windows symlink + NTFS junction + `.lnk` read/rewrite (compile-verified; see verify item below).
- ✅ Go unit tests (args/filters/transform/walk) + integration harness over scratch symlink trees.

#### Done - Bugs

#### Done - New features and enhancements

- ✅ `--confirm`: preview the whole plan, then one `y/N` prompt before writing anything (full-plan gate, not per-link). `process` builds the plan first, so one code path drives dry-run, confirm, and apply. Mutually exclusive with `--print0`.

- ✅ `--renormal-relative` / `--renormal-absolute`: re-normalize each target's spelling (relative to the link, or cleaned absolute). Runs after `--from`/`--to`, or standalone to tidy existing targets. Mutually exclusive; logical-path only (no symlink resolution), so the link still points at the same place.

- ✅ `-0` / `--print0`: machine output, one link path per NUL record, no human decorations or summary (list mode = matches, edit mode = links that change). For `xargs -0` style scripting.

- ✅ `-L` / `--follow-links`: descend into directory symlinks during the walk, loop-safe via a visited-canonical-path set (each directory walked once). Default walk still never follows.

- ✅ `--inc-target` / `--exc-target`: select links by their current target (where they point), not just their own path. Reuses the filter engine as a second ordered pipeline over the target. `--inc`/`--exc` short spellings preserved via an exact-alias table.

- ✅ `--no-cross-device`: don't descend into directories on another filesystem (`find -xdev` style). Per-OS device probe (POSIX `st_dev`, Windows volume serial); prunes at directory boundaries during the walk.

- ✅ Selection engine split into its own reusable package (`source/filter/`), independent of the CLI, so a later file-lister project can use it as-is. The CLI keeps a thin flag-to-rule adapter.

- ✅ Fuzz and security test suites: arg parser, glob translator, regex engine, and the selection pipeline under random input; link-follow safety, symlink-cycle safety, and timeout-bounded matching.
